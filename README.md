## Description

In an effort to optimize the website for search engines via accessibility standards, the webpage has been refactored with semantic elements throughout its html, alt-text has been added to images and section icons, and the company's title has been added to the page's head. With these changes, the website will be more user-friendly and result in higher pagination results with search engines.
